## üìù CBSE Class 10 Maths ‚Äì Chapter 3: Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables

### **Total Marks: 40 | Time: 1 Hour 30 Minutes**

### **Section A ‚Äì Very Short Answer (1 mark each)**

**\[1 √ó 4 = 4 marks]**

1. Write the condition for a pair of linear equations to have no solution.
2. Find the value of $k$ if the equations $3x + ky = 9$ and $6x + 12y = 18$ represent a pair of dependent equations.
3. Solve: $2x + 3y = 12$, $4x + 6y = 24$. How many solutions are there?
4. If one equation is $2x + y = 10$, write another equation that forms a consistent pair with it.

### **Section B ‚Äì Short Answer Type I (2 marks each)**

**\[2 √ó 3 = 6 marks]**

5. Solve the pair of equations using substitution method:

$$
x + y = 7,\quad x - y = 1
$$

6. Solve the pair:

$$
3x - 2y = 12,\quad 2x + y = 5
$$

7. Two numbers have a sum of 25. If twice one number is equal to three times the other, find the numbers using linear equations.

### **Section C ‚Äì Short Answer Type II (3 marks each)**

**\[3 √ó 3 = 9 marks]**

8. Solve the following pair of linear equations using cross-multiplication method:

$$
5x - 4y = 11,\quad -10x + 8y = -22
$$

9. Find the value of $a$ such that the pair of equations

$$
ax + y = 3,\quad 4x + ay = 4
$$

has **infinitely many solutions**.

10. The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. If the digits are reversed, the number increases by 27. Find the number.


### **Section D ‚Äì Long Answer Type (4 marks each)**

**\[4 √ó 3 = 12 marks]**

11. The father‚Äôs age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years, his age will be double the sum of their ages at that time. Find the present ages of the children.

12. Solve the following pair of equations graphically:

$$
x + 2y = 6,\quad 2x - y = 2
$$

Plot the graph and write the solution as coordinates. Also state the nature of the pair.

13. A boat can travel 30 km downstream in 2 hours and the same distance upstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream using the method of elimination.

### **Section E ‚Äì Application-Based Question (5 marks)**

**\[5 √ó 1 = 5 marks]**

14. A shopkeeper sells pens and pencils. He sold 20 items in a day, consisting of pens and pencils, and collected ‚Çπ280. If a pen costs ‚Çπ20 and a pencil costs ‚Çπ10, find how many pens and how many pencils he sold.
    Also, if he wants to earn ‚Çπ350 the next day by selling 25 items with the same rates, how many pens and pencils should he sell?
