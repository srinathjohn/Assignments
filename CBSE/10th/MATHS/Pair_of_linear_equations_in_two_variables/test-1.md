## 🧮 **SECTION A – Very Short Answer (1 × 4 = 4 marks)**

Attempt all questions.

1. Write the condition for a system of linear equations to have **infinitely many solutions**.

2. Solve:
   $x + y = 6$,
   $x - y = 2$

3. If two lines are **parallel**, what can you say about the number of solutions of their equations?

4. Find the value of $k$ for which the equations
   $kx + 2y = 3$ and $3x + ky = 5$
   have **no solution**.

## ✍️ **SECTION B – Short Answer Type I (2 × 4 = 8 marks)**

Attempt all questions.

5. Draw the graph of the pair of equations:
   $x + y = 4$ and $x - y = 2$
   Find the point of intersection.
   *(Use rough sketch if graph paper not available)*

6. A number consists of two digits. The digit in the tens place is twice the digit in the units place. If 27 is added to the number, the digits interchange their places. Find the number.

7. Solve by elimination:
   $2x + 3y = 12$,
   $3x + 2y = 12$

8. The sum of the numerator and denominator of a fraction is 5 more than twice the numerator. If the numerator and denominator are increased by 1, the fraction becomes $\dfrac{1}{2}$. Find the fraction.

## 🧠 **SECTION C – Short Answer Type II (3 × 4 = 12 marks)**

Attempt all questions.

9. The coach of a cricket team buys **3 bats and 6 balls** for ₹3900. Later, she buys **1 bat and 3 balls** for ₹1300. Represent this situation as a pair of linear equations. Solve using **substitution method**.

10. A train travels 360 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 5 km/h more, it would have taken 48 minutes less for the journey. Find the speed of the train.

11. Solve graphically:
    $x + 2y = 6$ and $2x - y = 4$
    Also write the coordinates of the point where the lines intersect.

12. Two numbers are such that the sum of twice the first and thrice the second is 36, and the sum of thrice the first and twice the second is 39. Find the numbers using elimination method.

## 📐 **SECTION D – Long Answer Type (4 × 4 = 16 marks)**

Attempt all questions.

13. A boat takes 6 hours to travel 30 km downstream and 18 km upstream. It would take 9 hours to travel 36 km downstream and 24 km upstream. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.

14. Solve the following word problem:

> A school collected ₹1050 in total from students of class 10. Each boy paid ₹20 and each girl paid ₹15. If the number of boys is 10 more than the number of girls, find the number of boys and girls.

15. A person invested ₹12,000 in two schemes A and B at 10% and 12% per annum respectively. At the end of one year, the total interest received was ₹1280. How much money was invested in each scheme?

16. Solve using cross-multiplication:

    $$
    3x - 4y = 10,\quad 2x + y = 3
    $$
