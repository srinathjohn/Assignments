### ðŸ“˜ **Section A â€“ Very Short Answer (1 mark Ã— 4 = 4 marks)**

1. Without solving, check whether the following pair has **infinitely many solutions**, **unique solution**, or **no solution**:

   $$
   3x - 2y = 5,\quad 6x - 4y = 11
   $$

2. The equations of two lines are:
   $a_1x + b_1y = c_1$ and $a_2x + b_2y = c_2$.
   Write the condition for these lines to be **parallel** but **not coincident**.

3. If the system

   $$
   2x + 3y = a,\quad 4x + 6y = b
   $$

   has infinitely many solutions, find the relationship between $a$ and $b$.

4. Find the value of $k$ if the system

   $$
   x + ky = 5,\quad 3x + 6y = 15
   $$

   has **infinitely many solutions**.

### ðŸ“— **Section B â€“ Short Answer I (2 marks Ã— 4 = 8 marks)**

5. Two numbers differ by 3. Three times the larger number is equal to **4 times the smaller number increased by 6**. Find the numbers.

6. A car rental company charges â‚¹x per day and â‚¹y per km driven. A customer pays â‚¹1,600 for 2 days and 100 km. Another pays â‚¹2,100 for 3 days and 150 km.
   Form the equations and find $x$ and $y$ using **elimination**.

7. Solve using **substitution** method:

   $$
   \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{3}{4},\quad \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{4}
   $$

8. Determine the point of intersection of the lines:
   $2x + y = 7$ and $4x + 2y = 14$
   Are these lines coincident? Justify your answer.

### ðŸ“˜ **Section C â€“ Short Answer II (3 marks Ã— 4 = 12 marks)**

9. A shopkeeper sells an article at 25% profit and another at 20% loss. Total cost price is â‚¹4,800 and total selling price is â‚¹4,860. Find the cost price of each article using linear equations.

10. A man can row 24 km downstream and return in 7 hours. If the speed of the current is 2 km/h, find his speed in still water.

11. Solve graphically:

$$
x + y = 4,\quad x - y = 2
$$

Also shade the region bounded by the two lines and the x-axis.

12. A number consists of two digits. The digit in the tens place is 4 more than the digit in the units place. If the digits are reversed, the number becomes 27 less than the original number. Find the number.

### ðŸ“™ **Section D â€“ Long Answer (4 marks Ã— 4 = 16 marks)**

13. A boat takes 2 hours to travel 30 km downstream and 3 hours to return upstream.
    Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream using **elimination method**.

14. (**Case-Based**)
    A factory makes two types of toys A and B. Each toy A requires **5 hours of assembly** and **3 hours of painting**. Each toy B requires **4 hours of assembly** and **6 hours of painting**. The factory has at most **100 hours for assembly** and **90 hours for painting** per week.

> (a) Represent the constraints as a pair of linear inequalities.
> (b) If the factory wants to **fully utilize** its resources each week and produce **10 toys in total**, form a pair of equations and solve it.
> (c) Interpret the result.

15. (**Generalisation**)
    A two-digit number is such that the sum of the digits is $x$. If the digits are reversed, the number increases by $9x - 90$.

> (a) Form a general linear equation in terms of $x$ and the units digit $y$.
> (b) Find all valid two-digit numbers satisfying this condition.

16. (**Challenging**)
    A train travels 600 km at a uniform speed. Had the speed been 10 km/h more, it would have taken **1 hour less**. Find the original speed using linear equation methods.
