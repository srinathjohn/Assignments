### **Chapter 3: Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables**

**Maximum Marks:** 40

**Time:** 90 Minutes

**Level:** Easy

### üìù General Instructions:

* All questions are **compulsory**.
* Use **stepwise solving** as marks are awarded for intermediate steps.
* Use of calculators is **not permitted**.
* The paper is divided into 4 sections, per CBSE blueprint, but with **enhanced difficulty**.

## üîπ **Section A ‚Äì VSA (1 mark each √ó 4 = 4 marks)**

1. Without solving, determine the nature of solutions of the system:

   $$
   2x - 3y = 7,\quad 4x - 6y = 10
   $$

2. For what value(s) of $k$ do the equations

   $$
   kx + y = 3,\quad 2x + ky = 4
   $$

   represent a pair of **coincident lines**?

3. A pair of linear equations has a solution at $(3, 1)$. Find a possible pair of equations with this solution **without solving**.

4. The point $P(a, b)$ lies on both the lines:
   $2x + 3y = 12$ and $x - y = 1$. Find the value of $a + b$.

## üîπ **Section B ‚Äì SA-I (2 marks each √ó 4 = 8 marks)**

5. The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. When the digits are reversed, the number is decreased by 27. Find the number.

6. Form and solve a system of equations:
   "A father is twice as old as his son. Five years ago, he was three times as old. What are their present ages?"

7. A pair of linear equations is given by:

   $$
   a_1x + b_1y = c_1,\quad a_2x + b_2y = c_2
   $$

   Derive the condition for **unique solution** in terms of the coefficients.

8. Ramesh bought 3 pencils and 4 pens for ‚Çπ48. Suresh bought 2 pencils and 5 pens for ‚Çπ50.
   Find the cost of one pencil and one pen using the **elimination method**.

---

## üîπ **Section C ‚Äì SA-II (3 marks each √ó 4 = 12 marks)**

9. Solve for $x$ and $y$:

   $$
   \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{5}{6},\quad \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{6}
   $$

   *(Hint: Use substitution after setting new variables.)*

10. A chemist has one solution of 50% alcohol and another of 25% alcohol. How much of each must he mix to make 10 liters of 40% alcohol? Form and solve the pair of equations.

11. A train takes 1 hour less to travel 180 km than another train. If the speed of the slower train is $x$ km/h and the faster is $x + 10$ km/h, form the equation and find the speeds.

12. Draw the graph of:

$$
3x - 2y = 6,\quad 2x + y = 4
$$

Find the point of intersection and shade the region bounded between the two lines.


## üîπ **Section D ‚Äì LA (4 marks each √ó 4 = 16 marks)**

13. Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in $x$ and $x - 2$ hours respectively. When both are opened together, the tank fills in 4 hours **more** than the time taken by Pipe A alone.
    Form a pair of linear equations and find $x$.

14. Solve using **cross-multiplication** method:

$$
7x - 5y = 2,\quad 3x + 2y = 6
$$

15. A shopkeeper sold two items, one at a profit of 20% and the other at a loss of 10%. The total cost price of both items was ‚Çπ2500. The total selling price was ‚Çπ2550. Find the cost price of each item.

16. (**Generalisation + Application**)
    A man invests a total of ‚Çπ10,000 in two schemes. In Scheme A, the annual return is $r\%$; in Scheme B, it's $r + 2\%$. His total return in one year is ‚Çπ1,040. If he invested ‚Çπx in Scheme A and the rest in Scheme B:

**(a)** Form a system of equations in $x$ and $r$.
**(b)** If $x = ‚Çπ6000$, find the value of $r$.
**(c)** Interpret the result.
