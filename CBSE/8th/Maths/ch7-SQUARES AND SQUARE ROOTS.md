# **SQUARES**

## 🔷 1. **Definition of Square**

* The **square of a number** is the result of multiplying the number by itself.

$$
\text{Square of } a = a^2 = a \times a
$$

* Example:
  $7^2 = 7 \times 7 = 49$


A number is called a **perfect square** if it is the square of an integer.

* Examples:
  $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 \ldots$

## 🔷 2. **Geometric Interpretation**

* The term **"square"** comes from geometry, where the area of a square shape with side length $s$ is:

$$
\text{Area} = s^2
$$

So squaring a number gives the **area** of a square with that number as its side.

## 🔷 3. **Basic Properties of Squares**

### 📘 1. **Square of a Number**

* The square of a number is the number multiplied by itself:

$$
a^2 = a \times a
$$

### 📗 2. **The Square of a Positive Number is Positive**

* Example:

  $3^2 = 9$
  
  $10^2 = 100$

### 📙 3. **The Square of a Negative Number is Also Positive**

* Because a negative number multiplied by itself gives a positive result:

$$
(-a)^2 = a^2
$$

* Example:

  $(-4)^2 = 16$

### 📘 4. **The Square of 0 is 0**

* Zero multiplied by zero is still zero.

$$
0^2 = 0
$$

### 📗 5. **Squares are Always Non-Negative**

* For any real number $a$,

$$
a^2 \geq 0
$$

* No square of a real number is negative.

### 📙 6. **Even and Odd Squares**

| Number Type | Property       | Example    |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Even        | Square is Even | $6^2 = 36$ |
| Odd         | Square is Odd  | $7^2 = 49$ |

### 📘 7. **Last Digit of a Square**

* Squares **end only in**:
  **0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9**
* A number ending in 2, 3, 7, or 8 **cannot** be a perfect square.

### 📗 8. **Number of Zeros in Squares**

* A number ending in zeros must have an **even number** of zeros to be a perfect square.

  * $10^2 = 100$ ✅ (2 zeros)
  * $100^2 = 10,000$ ✅ (4 zeros)
  * $1000$ ❌ Not a perfect square (3 zeros)

### 📙 9. **Square of a Fraction**

* Square the numerator and denominator separately:

$$
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
$$

* Example:
  $\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{16}$

### 📘 10. **Square of a Decimal**

* Multiply the number by itself.
  Carefully count decimal places.

  $$
  (0.5)^2 = 0.25,\quad (0.2)^2 = 0.04
  $$

### 📗 11. **Difference Between Two Squares**

* Formula:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
$$

* Example:

  $9^2 - 7^2 = 81 - 49 = 32$

### 📙 12. **Sum of First n Odd Numbers = n²**

* Example:

$$
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4^2
$$

### 📘 13. **Every Perfect Square Has an Odd Number of Factors**

* Example:

  36 has 9 factors:
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
  (It has a repeated middle factor: 6)

## 🔷 4. **Patterns in Square Numbers**

### 🔷 1. **Difference Between Consecutive Squares**

$$
(n + 1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1
$$

* This means the difference between the squares of two consecutive natural numbers is **always an odd number**, and increases by 2 each time.

✅ Example:

$$
6^2 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11 = 2(5) + 1
$$

### 🔷 2. **Sum of First n Odd Numbers = n²**

$$
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + (2n - 1) = n^2
$$

✅ Example:

$$
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 = 5^2
$$

This gives a beautiful visual pattern — if you build a square block layer by layer with increasing odd numbers, you get perfect squares.

### 🔷 3. **Square Numbers Ending in 5**

* Any number ending in **5** has a square that ends in **25**.

✅ Shortcut to square a number ending in 5:

Let the number be **x5** (like 25, 35, 75)

$$
(x5)^2 = x(x+1) \,|\, 25
$$

🧠 Just multiply the part before 5 by its successor, then attach 25.

✅ Examples:

* $25^2 = 2×3 = 6 \Rightarrow 625$
* $65^2 = 6×7 = 42 \Rightarrow 4225$
* $115^2 = 11×12 = 132 \Rightarrow 13225$

### 🔷 4. **Squares of Numbers Near 50**

Let $x = 50 + a$ or $50 - a$

$$
x^2 = 2500 + 100a + a^2 \quad \text{(when } x = 50 + a\text{)}
$$

$$
x^2 = 2500 - 100a + a^2 \quad \text{(when } x = 50 - a\text{)}
$$

✅ Examples:

* $52^2 = 2500 + 100(2) + 4 = 2604$
* $47^2 = 2500 - 100(3) + 9 = 2209$

### 🔷 5. **Squares of Numbers Ending in 1 and 9**

* The square of numbers ending in **1** and **9** both end in **1**.

✅ Examples:

* $21^2 = 441$
* $29^2 = 841$

### 🔷 6. **Multiples of 11 (Two-Digit Repeats)**

* For numbers like 11, 22, 33... their squares form **palindromic or patterned** results.

✅ Examples:

* $11^2 = 121$
* $22^2 = 484$
* $33^2 = 1089$
* $44^2 = 1936$
* Notice symmetry in $11^2 = 121$

### 🔷 7. **Reversing Digits Doesn't Guarantee Same Square**

* Even if two numbers are digit reversals, their squares are often unrelated.

✅ Example:

* $13^2 = 169$
* $31^2 = 961$

### 🔷 8. **Difference of Squares Trick**

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
$$

Useful to simplify large square differences:

✅ Example:

$$
104^2 - 96^2 = (104 + 96)(104 - 96) = 200 × 8 = 1600
$$

## 🔷 10. **Algebraic Identities Involving Squares**

| Identity                      | Name                  | Example                     |
|-------------------------- |------------------ |------------------------ |
| $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ | Expansion of square   | $(2+3)^2 = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25$ |
| $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$ | Square of difference  | $(5-2)^2 = 25 - 20 + 4 = 9$ |
| $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$  | Difference of squares | $9^2 - 7^2 = 81 - 49 = 32$  |

## 🔷 6. **Square of Negative Numbers**

* The square of a **negative number is positive**, because:

$$
(-a)^2 = (-a) \times (-a) = a^2
$$

* Example:

$$
(-8)^2 = 64
$$

## 🔷 8. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

* **Negative signs**: $-5^2$ is **not** equal to 25.
  It is interpreted as $-(5^2) = -25$ unless parentheses are used.
* **Squaring decimals**: Be careful with place value:

$$
(0.2)^2 = 0.04
$$

* **Don't mix rules**:
  $\sqrt{a + b} \ne \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$

## 🔷 9. **Interesting Facts about Squares**

* A number ending in:

  * **1 or 9** → Square ends in 1
  * **2 or 8** → **Never** a perfect square
  * **3 or 7** → **Never** a perfect square
  * **5** → Square ends in 25
* The square of any number ending in 5 ends in **25**
* The square of any number is either:

  * divisible by 4, or
  * leaves remainder 1 when divided by 4
